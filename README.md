# Introduction
Welcome to Falsebound, a proof of concept RTS/RPG game that takes elements of both genres and mixes them together in a fairly unique style. Armies of marshals lead teams of monsters against other armies in hopes of beating out the other. Take control of these marshals and their teams to beat out your opponent! (Note : Currently there is no actual battling, just monsters staring at each other in an empty void.)

# How to Install
Download the most recent version's zip file, and once download unzip it. From there, go to the **Applications** folder and then go into the **Falsebound1.0** folder then click on the **Falsebound.exe** to open the game.

# How to Play
Currently, the player can move their cursor around the screen. When a marshal collides with the player, the player may press F. If they do, the marshal becomes selected and can move where the player commands them to (indicated by the green line connecting them together). Sending a marshal colliding with another marshal will cause a battle to trigger between the two, pitting their teams against one another. (Note : It would if combat was included, but it is not.)

The player may also press E to scale the cursor up. However this does mess with the collision of the cursor, so don't expect to hit anything in state. To fix it, press R to scale yourself back to normal size. Move the cursor with WASD and interact with marshals with F. Using F while having another marshal selected will have that marshal move towards the location the player pressed F at.

# Known Bugs
Scaling up the player causes the collision on them to not work the same.
